# AI_The_Eight_Puzzle
**#Project Description**</br>
The Eight puzzle is a sliding block puzzle that challenges the player to arrange the numbers in increasing order starting from 1 to 8. 
The last tile is an empty block, which helps the player to arrange the tiles. In our project, the Eight puzzles are generalized into the N * N puzzle where 
we have N * N squared tiles with N * N-1 numbers engraved on them and the last tile is a blank tile. The same row and same positioned tiles can be moved 
horizontally or vertically by sliding them respectively. The aim of the N * N puzzle is to place the tiles in numerical order.

We are going to solve the puzzle using 3 search algorithms.
• Uniform Cost Search
• A* with Misplaced Tile Heuristics
• A* with Manhattan Distance Heuristics

Please find the report and Code for more details.
