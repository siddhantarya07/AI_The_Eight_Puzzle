# AI_The_Eight_Puzzle
THe Eight puzzle is a sliding block puzzle that challenges the player to arrange the numbers in increasing order starting from 1 to 8. The last tile is an empty block, which helps the player to arrange the tiles. In our project, the Eight puzzles are generalized into the N*N puzzle where we have N*N squared tiles with N*N-1 numbers engraved on them and the last tile is a blank tile. The same row and same positioned tiles can be moved horizontally or vertically by sliding them respectively. The aim of the N*N puzzle is to place the tiles in numerical order.
